## About

I am a Ph.D. Student in Geospatial Analytics at North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, under my advisor, [Dr. Helena Mitasova](https://meas.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/hmitaso/). I am a member of the NCSU GeoForAll Lab and a research and teaching assistant at the Center for Geospatial Analytics. Under the guidance of Dr. Mitasova, [Dr. Eric Money](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/directory/eric-money/) and [Dr. Michael Evans](https://ced.ncsu.edu/people/maevans6/), I work on the development and evaluation of the Geospatial Applications for Problem Solving [(GAPS)](http://gaps.cnr.ncsu.edu/) program, designed to introduce high school students to geospatial science, GIS, and advanced geovisualization technologies through an intensive after-school STEM learning experience.

My main research interests involve testing, assessing, and evaluating innovative geovisualization technologies for the support of spatial thinking, learning, decision making, and problem solving. My research strives to develop computational methods and tools with a human-computer interaction perspective. Overall, the evaluative techniques applied in my research aim to advance human-computer interaction by enabling intuitive understanding and exploration of spatial data.
